Public bike sharing is a hot topic among the nation recently. There
are a variety of analysis from different cities. In this PittBike project,  we
are going to conduct a deep dig out for Pittsburgh bike sharing
dataset, presenting our discovery of the bike sharing situation in
Pittsburgh.The visualization platform will be divided
into several
parts: **”Station overview”** ,**”Station balance viz”**,**”Trip
period frequency viz”**,**” Trip duration viz”**. Each part is
responsible for a specific visualization result. The “Station overview” section will give an overview including the station
geographical location, station details, station traffic statistics;
“Station balance viz” helps discover the reasonability of
current bike arrangement ; ”Trip period frequency viz” overviews the
trip frequency for each stations in a specific time period, and
“ Trip duration viz” shows the percentage of trip duration
for different customer types.
